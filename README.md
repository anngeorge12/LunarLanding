# LunarLanding
Designed an AI model using Deep Q-Learning to train an agent for controlled lunar landings. Implemented reinforcement learning algorithms with the Gymnasium library in Python to optimize landing strategies based on environmental feedback. Trained the agent to achieve stable and efficient landings by balancing thrust and navigation control.
